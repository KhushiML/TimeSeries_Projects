# TimeSeries_Projects
Time Series Analysis is a way of studying the characteristics of the response variable concerning time as the independent variable. To estimate the target variable in predicting or forecasting, use the time variable as the reference point. TSA represents a series of time-based orders, it would be Years, Months, Weeks, Days, Horus, Minutes, and Seconds. It is an observation from the sequence of discrete time of successive intervals. Some real-world application of TSA includes weather forecasting models, stock market predictions, signal processing, and control systems. Since TSA involves producing the set of information in a particular sequence, this makes it distinct from spatial and other analyses. We could predict the future using AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models.
